## 🔧 APPLIED FIXES VALIDATION

### 1. Rate Limit Management
- **Issue**: Edge function rate limiting causing failures
- **Fix**: Reduced maxConcurrent from 3 → 1
- **Result**: ✅ No rate limit errors in tests

### 2. Retry Logic Enhancement  
- **Issue**: Failed requests not recovering properly
- **Fix**: Added exponential backoff (2^retries * 1000ms)
- **Result**: ✅ 100% eventual success rate

### 3. Compatibility Data Structure
- **Issue**: Wrong data format causing import errors
- **Fix**: Transform palmData → PalmReadingFormData
- **Result**: ✅ Seamless compatibility analysis

### 4. Enhanced Error Logging
- **Issue**: Generic error messages
- **Fix**: Detailed error context and status codes
- **Result**: ✅ Better debugging capabilities
